## Project Goal

write a Dockerfile to:

- base on ubuntu image
- install brew and then use brew to install pyenv,
- then use pyenv install python 3.14.

Try to build the image and fix any errors you met. This webpage is probably useful for you when install python with pyenv because python has a lot of dependencies when building:<https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki>. Enable performance optimization flags as well.
